<article>
<p class="tab">One might call the college experience the ultimate balancing act; a battle of academia, social life and first-time independence. But just as students may be at risk of overcommitment, they can also be prone to self-isolation. <br><br>Cal Poly students of all differnet majors have taken it upon themselves to find ways to keep themselves busy, but in ways that are healthy and fulfilling. </p>

<article><!--beginning of article-->
<p class="tab">The college adaptation process varies by student, but four Cal Poly students individually agree that having a hobby or pastime has made their experience more fluid and manageable.
Their emotional wellbeing is stronger, their lives are more balanced and there is a comfort that comes with maintaining their passions outside of their academic work, they say — without their hobbies, their college lifestyles would be vastly different and less fulfilling. </p>

<img src="img/img.2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 24, 2023 — Third year nutrition major Alissa MacLoon has been drawing since she was in middle school. The koi fish pen drawing she shows in her room is one of many completed artworks. Her ability to commit time to this hobby fluctuates, but even still, MacLoon says that she still finds refuge in art. “My drawings aren’t always reflective of my mood, but when they are it really helps me get out of my own head and express things that normally I would not,” MacLoon says. “And [in] other ways though, it’s just a good pastime to help center myself I think, especially considering that I am constantly just memorizing things [for my major].”"/>
	
<img src="img/1.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 24, 2023 — MacLoon works on an unfinished graphite drawing inspired by the novel “Les Misérables.” Her sketchbook collection features a variety of art mediums, but Macloon prefers pen, graphite or lead, or watercolor. Now, she also experiments with digital art as well. MacLoon appreciates its convenience and portability when she is busy, especially with classes — digital art gives her the unique opportunity to take her passion and preferred method of stress relief “on the go,” she says."/>
	
<img src="img/img.4.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="April 23, 2023 — Pulling has a collection of seven volleyballs, but the volleyball he prefers (pictured) is much nicer than the rest — and more expensive, at around $80 per ball. Its value stems from its use by the Association of Volleyball Professionals, and although Pulling owns two now, he did not make the investment until he started playing more on his own last year. For Cal Poly’s club tryouts fall quarter of 2021, Pulling had arrived 20 minutes early. With no one but one other player, Luke Powers, there early as well, they warmed up together. They initially did not make the team, but continued to play together and eventually make the team together during spring tryouts of 2022. Now, they continue to partner for practice and tournaments. Volleyball has been “a good way to exercise, and that alone allows you to exert energy,” Pulling says, “and it helps so I don’t have to think about school.”"/>
	
<img src="img/img.3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 23, 2023  — Rhys Pulling, a third year computer science major, practices setting his volleyball on the lawn outside of Cal Poly’s College of Business. He sometimes chooses to practice on grass, but as a current member of Cal Poly’s club beach volleyball team, he mostly plays on sand. Pulling was introduced to the sport early in his life — his parents and two sisters actively play as well, his mother having played professionally and his father in college. He began to take interest in the sport during his sophomore year of high school, when he started playing doubles, or on two-person teams. Pulling prefers playing outside because it is “more constant playing” than indoor volleyball, and it also gives him the opportunity to become closer with his one partner."/>
	
<img src="img/img.5.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 24, 2023 — Eli Sandoval, a third year psychology major, has many pastimes that keep him busy, but his favorite ones revolve around the arts, including photography, watching films and reading. They are “fulfilling,” Sandoval says, for he has found that having more creative hobbies allows him “to tap a side of me that isn’t always tapped by college.”"/>
	
<img src="img/img.6.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 24, 2023 — Sandoval owns two cameras — the older Kodak Vigilant Six-20 (left) and modern Canon EOS Rebel T6 (right) — and displays both on the windowsill in his bedroom. The Kodak camera came with four types of lenses with a variety of abilities including changes in shutter types and aperture lengths, and was manufactured from 1939 to 1949; he bought the older camera in September of 2022. “I got [it] because I love photography and I feel like this camera is a really amazing piece of camera history,” Sandoval says. “It is a cool piece to admire and I love the history behind it.” He enjoys that he can “create my own things” with photography, both through the editing process and by finding “cool shots and angles” when actively taking photos. Sandoval began taking photos only within the past few years, and says there’s “been more of a surge to want to continue to get better at it.” "/>
	
<img src="img/img.7.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 24, 2023 — Sandoval enjoys reading from a variety of genres. His nonfiction books offer him the ability to learn more beyond what is taught in his classes, such as with history; the fiction genre alternatively allows Sandoval to escape and experience a set of emotions different from what he personally may be experiencing. “I feel like it fills up [my time] in a productive way. I can be filling [it with] lots of other things — I could be filling up with all the things that might be fun in the moment that might not be conducive to my long term mental and emotional well being or physical well being,” Sandoval says. Additionally, he says his hobbies allow him to “develop as a human being.” "/>

<img src="img/img.10.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 25, 2023 — Emily Goetz, a first year anthropology major, graduated high school in 2020, but took two years off for herself before deciding to attend Cal Poly. During that time, Geotz needed a hobby to keep her occupied — so, she turned to yoga as a way to center herself. In college, she tries to maintain yoga to help her “regulate the emotional turbulence that is college.” She mostly does yoga at Cal Poly’s recreational center in the afternoons. “It’s good to have something to turn to when life seems like a lot or nothing at all,” Goetz says."/>

<img src="img/img.9.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 25, 2023 — A common yoga pose that Goetz often performs is the king pigeon pose, known as Eka Pada Rajakapotasana in Sanskrit, which she practices on Baker lawn. She realized she could first do it in February of 2022, and was surprised to find out that she was capable of it — which is yet another reason that yoga is a valuable part of Goetz’s life. “You can both feel yourself and see yourself improving and mastering things that just take practice and time and patience and it’s really fun to just try something new and realize that your body is capable of it,” she says."/>

<img src="img/img.8.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="April 23, 2023 — Goetz keeps an unfinished friendship bracelet tied to her water bottle, which she carries with her everywhere. Even while it’s not as significant in her life as yoga, making friendship bracelets offers a creative outlet that she can turn to at any time. She first adopted this hobby during a foreign exchange program in Costa Rica when she was in high school as a way to “occupy my hands and let my mind wander,” she says. College has proven to be an equally unfamiliar environment, and so she continues to return to this hobby. Goetz also appreciates that working on a bracelet can help her with introspection, and is something she can turn to instead of her phone since her mind “tends to sit with anxiety a lot.”"/>
